# Automatic_Run
Are you fall in love with Linux' console, yet without reciprocity? Additionally, you don't like zsh or other variations of bash?  
And want to compile and run cpp's file with one command? Try this. (Program compiles with c++11's standard, but you can simply change one number inside the file.)
```
./cpprun.sh NAMEOFYOURPROGRAM.cpp
```
